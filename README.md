# Extreme Todo Golang
### But why?
Like most over-engineered apps, this is purely educational purposes - hopefully.

The topics that will be explored will include:
* Database migration with [Golang](https://go.dev/) and [SQLC](https://sqlc.dev/)
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) async streaming replication. (read-replicas)
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) using [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fmacos%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download)
